# 🌾 AgriSight-Analytics - AI-Powered Crop Recommendation & Analytics Platform

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

AgriSight-Analytics is an end-to-end AI-powered crop recommendation system that helps farmers and agribusinesses make data-driven decisions to optimize crop yield and sustainability. The platform leverages soil, weather, and environmental data to recommend the most suitable crops for given conditions, alongside powerful analytics dashboards built using Streamlit and Power BI.

The goal is to empower stakeholders in agriculture with actionable insights, improving productivity and resource management through smart technology.
